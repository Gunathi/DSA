In this repository I include my practices of Data Structures and Algorithms
1. Arrays
     - 2D array
     - Insert Element
     - Traversal through array
     - Delete element from array
2. Singly Linked List
     - Implementation
     - Insert node at the begining, end and at any given position of the linked list
     - Delete from the begining, end and from an any given position of linked list
3. Doubly Linked List
     - Implementation of doubly linked list
     - Insert node at the begining, end and at any given position of the linked list
     - Delete from the begining, end and from an any given position of linked list
     - Reverse
4. Singly Circular Linked List
     - Implementation of singly circular linked list
     - Insert node at the begining, end and at any given position of the linked list
     - Delete from the begining, end and from an any given position of linked list
     - Reverse
