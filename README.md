In this repository I include my practices of Data Structures and Algorithms
1. Arrays
     - 2D array
     - Insert Element
     - Traversal through array
     - Delete element from array
2. Singly Linked List
     - Implementation
     - Insert node at the begining of the linked list
     - Insert node at the end of the linked list
     - Insert node at specific position
     - Delete from the begining of linked list
     - Delete from the end of the Linked list
     - Delete from a specific position of the linked list
3. Doubly Linked List
     - Implementation of doubly linked list
     - Insert a node at the begining of the linked list
     - Insert a node at the end of the linked list
     - Insert a node at a given position of the linked list
     - Delete from begining of the LL
     - Delete from the end of the LL
     - Delete from the given specific position of the LL
